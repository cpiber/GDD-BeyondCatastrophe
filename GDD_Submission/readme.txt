(1) Short Game Description
	Due to climate changes and dramatic disasters in the world’s environment, nations started
	to attack each other to ensure essential resources. This war nearly destroyed the world as
	we know it, and new challenges and catastrophes arose. Before the war began, you moved
	away from civilization to calm your stressful life as a software developer and would never
	think this would save your life. Due to this fortunate circumstance, you are one of the last
	persons who survived the war on resources. But now this fact revenges since you got to
	gather food, fuel for your generator, and most of all – find your family!
